### Hi, I'm Sam 👋

I’m Sam, a product manager and designer. My goal as a design practitioner is to create spaces and tools that make people feel like they’re at home, because people who are confident in their surroundings and circumstances are happier, stronger people. To this end, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to foster confidence, security, inclusivity, and mastery in the products I build.

#### Here's what I'm up to

- 🌱 Learning Svelte
- 🌲 Finishing up my MBA at Stanford's Graduate School of Business
- 🙁 Coding lots of coursework that I'm not allowed to post online (RIP my contributions graph...)
- ✏️ Occasionally writing tutorials, musings, and build logs on my [blog](https://samlinville.com)

#### A little more about me
- 😄 My pronouns are he/him/his
- 👨🏻‍💻 Former Red Hatter, worked on OpenShift Networking and UX for deploying RHEL on public clouds (Details on <a href="http://samlinville.com/resume" target="_blank">my resume</a>)
